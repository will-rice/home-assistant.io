[BleBox](https://blebox.eu/?lang=en) produces small, low-power, surprisingly affordable, feature-rich WiFi devices for serverless home automation.

## Configuration

For the best experience, make sure your BleBox devices have the most recent available firmware installed.

This integration can be configured using the integrations in the
Home Assistant frontend.

Menu: **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

Click on the `+` sign to add an integration and click on **BleBox**.
After completing the configuration flow, the BleBox
integration will be available.

Additionally, if you are configuring a gateBox, it may be useful to set the second button as "stop" in your device's settings (via website or phone app).
