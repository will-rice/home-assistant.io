The Control4 integration allows you to control and monitor lights from your local Control4 system. Your Control4 controller must be running OS 3.0+.

## Configuration

Before setting up, you should assign a static IP address/DHCP reservation on your router to your Control4 controller. Home Assistant must be able to communicate with the controller over the local network; 4Sight remote access is not supported.

Setup the Control4 integration by going to **Configuration** -> **Integrations** -> **Control4**.

Enter the IP address of your controller and your Control4 username and password, then continue. Home Assistant will automatically add all lights it discovers in your Control4 system.

## Options

The Control4 integration offers additional options in **Configuration** -> **Integrations** -> **Control4** -> **Options**:
