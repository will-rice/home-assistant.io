The `spider` integration is the main integration to integrate all [Itho Daalderop Spider](https://www.ithodaalderop.nl/spider-thermostaat) related platforms. You will need your Spider account information (username, password) to discover and control devices which are related to your account.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Climate
- Switch

## Configuration

To set up this integration, click Configuration in the sidebar and then click Integrations. Add a new integration using the "+" button in the lower right corner and look for 'Itho Daalderop Spider'. Click configure and you will be presented with a dialog requesting the username and password of your Spider account information. After you click submit, it will automatically retrieve your thermostats and power plugs from mijn.ithodaalderop.nl.

If you'd like to continue using YAML until it is fully removed, you can use the following example:

```yaml
spider:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: Account username of mijn.ithodaalderop.nl
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Account password of mijn.ithodaalderop.nl
  required: true
  type: string
scan_interval:
  description: How frequently to query for new data. Defaults to 120 seconds.
  required: false
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>
This integration is not affiliated with Itho Daalderop Spider and retrieves data from the endpoints of the mobile application. Use at your own risk.

### Climate

<div class='note'>
Although this integration lets you change the operation mode to heating or cooling, it doesn't necessarily mean your boiler can. Spider is not aware of your current situation.
