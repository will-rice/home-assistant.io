The `template` integrations creates weather provider that combines integrations and an existing weather provider into a fused weather provider.

There are several powerful ways to use this integration, including localizing your weather provider information with local information from temperature, humidity, pressure sensors that you own.

Another use case could be using temperature and humidity from one weather plaform, with forecasts from a different one.


## Configuration

To enable a Template Weather provider in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
weather:
  - platform: template
    name: "my very own weather station"
    condition_template: "sunny"
    temperature_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float}}"
    humidity_template: "{{ states('sensor.humidity')| float }}"
    forecast_template: "{{ states.weather.my_region.attributes.forecast }}"
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration %}

  required: true
  type: string
condition_template:

  required: true
  type: template
temperature_template:

wind_speed_template:

  required: false

{% endconfiguration %}

## Considerations

If you are using the state of a integration that takes extra time to load, the Template Weather may get an `unknown` state during startup. This results in error messages in your log file until that integration has completed loading. If you use `is_state()` function in your template, you can avoid this situation.
