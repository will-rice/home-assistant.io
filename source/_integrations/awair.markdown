The Awair integration will fetch data from your [Awair devices](https://getawair.com).

You will need to request access to the Awair API and obtain an access token from the Awair [Developer Console](https://developer.getawair.com/). It is free, but getting a token can take up to 24 hours.

## Configuring the Platform

To enable the Awair integration, add your Awair account from the integrations page.

If you previously configured this integration via configuration.yaml, then your configuration will be imported for you. Only the `access_token` key is imported, and all other configuration is ignored.

## Available Sensors

The integration will fetch data from each device linked to your Awair developer account. The following sensors are supported:

  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Carbon dioxide
  * Total volatile organic compounds
  * PM2.5 density
  * PM10 density
  * Sound level
  * Luminescence

Not all devices support all sensors; consult Awair's documentation to find out what sensors are present on your device. For first-generation Awair devices with a "dust" sensor, the integration will create identical PM2.5 and PM10 sensors (which reflects the capabilities of the sensor - it can detect dust between PM2.5 and PM10 but cannot differentiate between them).

This integration refreshes once every 5 minutes, based on the [default per-device quota](https://docs.developer.getawair.com/?version=latest#tiers--quotas) of 300 API calls per day.
