## Configuration

To add the AVM FRITZ!SmartHome integration to your installation, go to **Configuration** -> **Integrations** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations select **AVM FRITZ! SmartHome**.

If you have enabled SSDP discovery, itâ€™s likely that you just have to confirm the detected device with username and password.

### Configuration via YAML

YAML configuration is still around for people that prefer YAML, but it's deprecated and you should not use it anymore.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fritzbox:
  devices:
    - password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```


{% configuration %}
