This integration allows you to control a Z-Wave network via [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/).

## Requirements

Controlling your Z-Wave network with the Z-Wave JS integration is split up into two parts:

1. The [Z-Wave JS Server](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server) is the gateway between your Z-Wave USB stick and Home Assistant. You can run this server separately from Home Assistant so your Z-Wave mesh will keep running if you restart or stop Home Assistant. The Home Assistant Z-Wave JS integration connects to this server with a websocket connection.

2. The Z-Wave JS integration in Home Assistant. This integration connects to the Z-Wave JS Server to retrieve the info from your Z-Wave network.

### Supervisor managed installation

- The official Z-Wave JS add-on installed available from the add-on store.

### Core installation

- The Z-Wave JS Server installed and running in your network.
- We provide an official add-on which you can find in the Supervisor's add-on store.
- Not running the Supervisor? The [Z-Wave JS 2 MQTT project](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwavejs2mqtt/#/getting-started/quick-start) also includes the Z-Wave JS Server (you can enable it in the settings) and they provide a Docker image.

### Hardware requirements

- [Supported Z-Wave dongle](/docs/z-wave/controllers/#supported-z-wave-usb-sticks--hardware-modules). The Z-Wave controller dongle should be connected to the same host as where the Z-Wave JS server is running.

## Configuration

This integration can be configured using the integrations in the
Home Assistant frontend.

Menu: **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

Click on the `+` sign to add an integration and click on **Z-Wave JS**.
After completing the configuration flow, the Z-Wave JS integration will be
available.

### Secure network key

The secure network key is set in the settings for zwave-js-server and
not in the integration configuration.

## Current Limitations

As this integration is still in the early stages there are some important limitations to be aware of.

- Garage door controllers (Barrier Operator CC) are not currently supported.
- Configuration of Z-Wave nodes and/or configuration with the Home Assistant UI is currently not yet implemented. You will need to use another tool, such as [zwavejs2mqtt](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwavejs2mqtt), to manage device configuration.
- Polling is currently not supported but may be added in a later release.
- Support for setting configuration parameters through service calls is currently not supported but may be added in a later release.
- There currently is no migration path from any of the other Z-Wave implementations in Home Assistant. Your Z-Wave network is however stored on your stick so migrating will only require you to redo your device and entity naming.


## Services

### Service `zwave_js.set_lock_usercode`

This service will set the usercode of a lock to X at code slot Y.
Valid usercodes are at least 4 digits.

| Service Data Attribute | Required | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | Lock entity or list of entities to set the usercode. |
| `code_slot`            | yes      | The code slot to set the usercode into.              |
| `usercode`             | yes      | The code to set in the slot.                         |

### Service `zwave_js.clear_lock_usercode`

This service will clear the usercode of a lock in code slot X.
Valid code slots are between 1-254.

| Service Data Attribute | Required | Description                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `entity_id`            | no       | Lock entity or list of entities to clear the usercode. |
| `code_slot`            | yes      | The code slot to clear the usercode from.              |

## Events

### Event `zwave_js_event`

This event is fired whenever a [notification](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/node?id=quotnotificationquot) or [value notification](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/node?id=quotvalue-notificationquot) event is received.

#### Notifications

Notifications are events sent using the Notification command class. The `parameters` attribute in the example below is optional, and when it is included, the keys in the attribute will vary depending on the event.

Notification exapmle:
```json
{
    "type": "notification",
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "label": "Keypad lock operation",
    "parameters": {"userId": 1}
}
```

#### Value Notifications

Value Notifications are used for stateless values, like `Central Scenes`.

Value Notification example:
```json
{
    "type": "value_notification",
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "endpoint": 0,
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "command_class": 32,
    "command_class_name": "Basic",
    "label": "Event value",
    "property_name": "event",
    "property_key_name": "some value",
    "value": 255,
}
```

## Troubleshooting Issues

### Get a dump of the current network state

When trying to determine why something isn't working as you expect, or when reporting an issue with the integration, it is helpful to know what Z-Wave JS sees as the current state of your Z-Wave network. To get a dump of your current network state, follow the menu: 

**Configuration** -> **Integrations** -> **Z-Wave JS** -> **Configure** -> **Download a dump of your network to help diagnose issues**

### Watch traffic between the server and the integration (Advanced Users)

Z-Wave JS Server comes with a client that can be used to see the messages that the server is sending and to check the state of a node/all nodes as well. Visit the [`zwave-js-server` repository](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server/) and follow the instructions in the README.
