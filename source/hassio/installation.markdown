The following will take you through the steps required to install Home Assistant OS.

1. Download the appropriate install option:

   - As an image for your device:

     - [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and B+ 32-bit][pi3-32] 
     - [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and B+ 64-bit][pi3-64]
     - [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (1 GB, 2 GB and 4 GB model) 32-bit][pi4-32] 
     - [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB and 8 GB model) 64-bit][pi4-64] (64-bit is required for 8 GB model)
     - [Tinkerboard][tinker]
     - [Odroid-C2][odroid-c2], [Odroid-C4][odroid-c4], [Odroid-N2][odroid-n2], [Odroid-XU4][odroid-xu4]
       - [Guide: Flashing Odroid-N2 using OTG-USB][otg-usb]
     - [Intel NUC][intel-nuc]

   - As a virtual appliance (x86_64/UEFI):
  
     - [VMDK][vmdk], [VHDX][vhdx], [VDI][vdi], [QCOW2][qcow2], [OVA][Virtual Appliance]

2. Install Home Assistant OS:

   - **For the device images:** Flash the downloaded image to an SD card using [balenaEtcher][balenaEtcher]. If using a Pi, we recommend at least a 32 GB SD card to avoid running out of space.
   - **For the virtual appliance images:** Load the appliance image into your virtual machine software. (Note: You are free to assign as much resources as you wish to the VM, please assign enough based on your add-on needs)
     - For VirtualBox create a new virtual machine, select "Other Linux (64Bit), assign it at least 2 GB of memory and "Use an existing virtual hard disk file", select the VDI file from above, afterwards edit the "Settings" of the VM and go "System" then Motherboard and Enable EFI, then "Network" "Adapter 1" Bridged and your adapter.
     - For Hyper-V download the VHDX file and unpack it using 7-Zip. Create a new virtual machine, select "Generation 2", assign it at least 2 GB of memory and select "Connection -> "Your Virtual Switch that is bridged", then "Use an existing virtual hard disk" and select the upacked VHDX file. After creation go to "Settings" -> "Security" and deselect "Enable Secure Boot".
     - For KVM download the QCOW2 file and unpack it using `unxz`. Create a new virtual machine in `virt-manager`, select "Import existing disk image", provide the path to the unpacked QCOW2 image, choose "Generic Default" for the operating system, assign at least 2 GB memory and 1 vCPU, check the box for "Customize configuration before install" and select your bridge under "Network Selection", then under customization select "Overview" -> "Firmware" -> "UEFI x86_64: ...". If you want mDNS and another multicast to work, you'll need to manually edit the XML to add trustGuestRxFilters='yes' to the interfaces tag. See virsh or virt-manager documentation for how to do that.
     - For Vmware Workstation download the VMDK file and unpack it using 7-Zip or `unxz`. Create a new virtual machine, select "Custom", make it compatible with the default of Workstation and ESX, Choose "I will install the operating system later", select "Linux" -> "Other Linux 5.x or later kernel 64-bit", give it at least 2 GB RAM and 1vCPU, select "Use Bridged Networking" then "Use an existing virtual disk" and select the unpacked VMDK file, after creation of VM go to "Settings" and "Options" then "Advanced" and select "Firmware type" to "UEFI".
     - For Proxmox, create a new virtual machine, and make note of the VM ID. Under "OS", select "Do not use any media". Under "System" select "Advanced" and change "BIOS" to "OVMF (UEFI)", then select a storage location for the EFI disk. Under "Hard Disk", create a default hard disk (we will delete this later). Set your CPU, memory, and network as needed. From the command line (as root on the Proxmox host), download the qcow2 image with `wget` or `curl` and decompress it (`unxz hassos_ova-5.10.qcow2.xz`). Then, import the disk to your VM, changing the VM ID as needed (`qm importdisk ### hassos_ova-5.10.qcow2 local-lvm --format qcow2`). After you see `Successfully imported disk`, you can remove the qcow2 image (`rm hassos_ova-5.10.qcow2`). Back in the web UI, navigate to your VM, then "Hardware" and locate the default hard disk we created earlier (probably called `disk0`). Click on it, then click "Detach", then click on the disk again and click "Remove" (this should leave you with two disks: the EFI disk and the imported qcow2 disk). Click on the qcow2 disk (probably called `disk2`) and click "Edit" then "Add". Click on the qcow2 disk one last time, then click on "Resize disk" and set your size (Home Assistant will fill up this entire space).
     - For VMware ESXi/vSphere installation use the "E1001" or "E1001E" virtual network adapater. There are confirmed mDNS/Multicast discovery issues when using VMware's "VMXnet3" virtual network adapter.  

3. Optional - set up the Wi-Fi or a static IP address. There are two possible places for that:
   - on a blank USB stick with a FAT32 partition having partition label `CONFIG`, while in its root directory, create the `network/my-network` file, or
   - on the Home Assistant SD card's first, bootable partition (labeled `hassos-boot`, might not be auto mounted in Linux) create the `CONFIG/network/my-network` file.

   For the content of this file, follow the [Home Assistant Operating System howto][hassos-network].

4. For image-based installs insert the SD card (and optional USB stick) into the device.

5. Turn on your device or virtual appliance. On first boot, it downloads the latest version of Home Assistant which takes around 20 minutes (slower/faster depending on the platform and your Internet connection).

   <img src='/images/hassio/screenshots/first-start.png' style='clear: right; border:none; box-shadow: none; float: right; margin-bottom: 12px;' width='150' />

6. You will be able to reach your installation at `http://homeassistant.local:8123` (if your router supports mDNS, otherwise see below).

7. From here, you have two options - either configure your Home Assistant from scratch, or restore a saved snapshot with all its settings and add-ons that you saved in the past.

<div class='note warning'>

We used `hassio.local` in the past, if you have a system that is installed before this naming change, you might need to use `hassio.local` instead of `homeassistant.local`.

</div>

<div class='note'>

If your router doesn't support mDNS, then you'll have to use the IP address of your Pi instead of `homeassistant.local`. For example, `http://192.168.0.9:8123`. You should be able to find the IP address of your Pi from the admin interface of your router.

</div>

<div class='note warning'>

If you are using a Raspberry Pi please remember to ensure you're using an [appropriate power supply][pi-power] with your Pi. Mobile chargers may not be suitable since some were only designed to provide just enough power to the device it was designed for by the manufacturer. **Do not** try to power the Pi from the USB port on a TV, computer, or similar.

</div>

Now you can [configure][configure] your install.

## Updating a Home Assistant installation

Best practice for updating a Home Assistant installation:

1. Backup your installation, using the snapshot functionality Home Assistant offers.
2. Check the release notes for breaking changes on [Home Assistant release notes](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases). Be sure to check all release notes between the version you are running and the one you are upgrading to. Use the search function in your browser (`CTRL + f`) and search for **Breaking Changes**.
3. Check your configuration using the [Check Home Assistant configuration](/addons/check_config/) add-on.
4. If the check passes, you can safely update. If not, update your configuration accordingly.
5. Select _Dashboard_ from the _Supervisor_ menu, and then select _Update_.

## Run a specific version of Home Assistant

For this you would need to install the [Terminal & SSH add-on][ssh] or use the console
that is available on your device by connecting a keyboard and screen.

To install the Terminal & SSH add-on, choose **Supervisor**, which is located in the sidebar and then the add-on store.

Use the web-based terminal or SSH to your Home Assistant system, or connect to the console, and run:

```bash
ha core update --version=X.Y.Z
```

Replacing `X.Y.Z` with your desired version (i.e., `2020.12.0` or `0.118.5`).

## Run the beta version of Home Assistant

If you would like to test next release before anyone else, you can install the beta version released every month:

1. Backup your installation, using the snapshot functionality Home Assistant offers.
2. Check the [Home Assistant Beta release notes](https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/) for breaking changes. Be sure to check all release notes between the version you are running and the one you are upgrading to. Use the search function in your browser (`CTRL + f`) and search for **Breaking Changes**.
3. Select _System_ tab from the _Supervisor_ menu, then select _Join Beta Channel_ under _Supervisor_, then select _Reload_.
4. Select _Dashboard_ tab from the _Supervisor_ menu, and then select _Update_.
